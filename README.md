# PulseBoard 📊

Production-grade SaaS analytics dashboard built to simulate real product environments.

PulseBoard is a system-level frontend engineering showcase designed to demonstrate dashboard architecture, data visualization, and SaaS interface development.

This project is part of the GigDevOS capability lab — created to replace NDA-protected client dashboards with anonymized product demonstrations.

---

## ✨ Overview

PulseBoard replicates the internal dashboard experience of a modern SaaS platform.

It showcases how product teams monitor metrics, manage users, analyze growth, and operate subscription systems within a unified interface.

The project focuses on:

• Product dashboard design
• Analytics visualization
• User management systems
• Billing interfaces
• Operational reporting UI

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Many production dashboards cannot be publicly shared due to NDAs.

PulseBoard exists to demonstrate:

• Real-world dashboard engineering
• Data-heavy UI architecture
• Component system scalability
• Product-grade interface design

It serves as a flagship demo for freelance and gig capability positioning.
